# Testing Strategy
## Unit Testing

### Objective
To validate the functionality of individual components of the online learning platform.

### Scope
- **UI Components:** Test each button, form, and user input field in isolation to ensure they capture and process data correctly.<br>
- **Course Creation Tools:** Validate the course editor functionalities like text editing, video uploads, and resource attachments.<br>
- **Payment System:** Verify the calculation of prices, discounts, and processing of transactions.<br>
- **Learner Management System:** Ensure that user data is correctly managed, including sign-ups, progress tracking, and certification issuance.<br>

### Procedure:
- Identify all individual components that can be tested in isolation.<br>
- Write test cases that cover all possible inputs and outputs for each component.<br>
- Automate unit tests using a framework appropriate for the platformâ€™s technology stack (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, JUnit for Java).<br>
- Integrate unit testing into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure tests are run with every code commit.<br>
- Review test reports and address any failed tests immediately.<br>
**Tools:** Use code coverage tools to ensure a high percentage of code is covered by unit tests.<br>

## Integration Testing

### Objective
To ensure that different modules of the platform work together as expected.

### Scope
- **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Test the interaction between user interfaces and server-side processes.<br>
- **Database Connectivity:** Ensure that the application correctly queries and writes to the database.<br>
- **Third-Party Integration:** Verify the integration with external APIs, such as payment gateways and email services.<br>
- **Cross-Module Functionality:** Check the seamless operation between the course creation module, learner management, and payment system.<br>

### Procedure:
- Outline the flow of data across modules and identify critical integration points.<br>
- Develop test cases that mimic real-world user behavior and data processing between modules.<br>
- Use an integration testing framework to create and execute test scenarios (e.g., Postman for API testing, Selenium for UI testing).<br>
- Conduct tests initially in a controlled environment, then in a staging environment that replicates production.<br>
- Resolve defects found during integration testing before moving on to system testing.<br>
**Tools:** Utilize test management tools to document, execute, and track integration tests.<br>

## Execution:
- Begin testing as soon as the first two units that interact are ready.<br>
- Follow a top-down or bottom-up approach, depending on module readiness and project priorities.<br>
- Utilize service virtualization if dependent modules are not yet developed.<br>
